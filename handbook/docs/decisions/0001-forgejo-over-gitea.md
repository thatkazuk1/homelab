# ADR-0001: Forgejo over Gitea for self-hosted Git

## Status

Accepted — 2026-06-25

## Context

The GitOps pipeline needs a self-hosted Git server to act as the canonical source of truth
for the homelab monorepo, with a one-way push mirror to a public GitHub repository for
visibility and disaster recovery.

The initial instinct was **Gitea** — the longest-established project in this space, well
documented, and a common recommendation in homelab communities historically. Before
committing, that assumption was checked against current community consensus rather than
carried forward from stale general knowledge, since the self-hosted Git landscape has shifted
meaningfully in the last few years.

## Decision

Use **Forgejo**, not Gitea.

## Reasoning

Forgejo forked from Gitea in 2022, originally as a community response to governance concerns.
The two projects remain API-compatible — most Gitea documentation, integrations, and
migration paths apply equally to Forgejo, and moving between them later (in either direction)
is straightforward if this decision ever needs revisiting.

The deciding factors:

- **Governance.** Forgejo is stewarded by a non-profit lineage, with a stated commitment to
  staying fully FOSS. Gitea is backed by a commercial entity. For a homelab project explicitly
  intended to be documented and shared publicly, aligning with the more clearly non-commercial
  governance model fits the project's own posture better.
- **Community consensus.** A live check of current recommendations confirmed Forgejo has
  become the default suggestion for new self-hosted Git setups, specifically in topologies
  similar to this one — single-node, Docker-based, paired with a GitOps deployment layer
  downstream.
- **No material technical downside.** Feature parity is close enough, and API compatibility
  close enough, that this is not a capability trade-off. Everything built downstream of this
  choice (SOPS, Komodo, the wiki generation pipeline) is identical regardless of which of the
  two is chosen.

## Consequences

- Forgejo is deployed as a single Docker container on a dedicated host (`forgejo-prod-01`),
  SQLite-backed.
- Documentation, scripts, and any future automation reference Forgejo's API/CLI conventions
  specifically (`forgejo admin user ...` rather than `gitea admin user ...`, etc.) — close to
  identical to Gitea's but not always byte-for-byte.
- If Forgejo's governance or maintenance trajectory changes materially, the API compatibility
  with Gitea means a future migration is a bounded, well-understood piece of work rather than
  a rebuild.

## Alternatives considered

- **Gitea** — rejected on governance grounds, despite being a perfectly competent technical
  choice. Not rejected for any functional deficiency.
- **GitHub-only (no self-hosted leg)** — rejected from the outset. The project's stated
  priority is a self-hosted, declarative source of truth for the homelab; depending on a
  third-party platform as the canonical store contradicts that goal. GitHub is retained as a
  one-way mirror for visibility and off-site redundancy, not as the source of truth.
